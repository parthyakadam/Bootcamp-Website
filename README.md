# Bootcamp-Website

This project is a single page website designed completely only using Bootstrap 5. The website provides a bootcamp course for all the learners to start as a front end web developer. The website is completely resposive and can used on any device. This project was made successful using following technologies:
    
    1. HTML
    2. CSS  
    3. Bootstrap

In future this project can be turned into a deployable website by connecting backend technologies to it.

## Lessons Learned

During the implimentation of projects I faced lot of challenges in Bootstrap classes as it was my first project using Bootstrap. Learnt lot of new things like using cards, navbar, grid-system, breakpoints & Google Maps API. I used various sources from Stackoverflow, Youtube, FreeCodeCamp etc. to overcome these challenges.
